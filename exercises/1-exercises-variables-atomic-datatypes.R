# Interlude 1
# Datatype/variable exercises
# ==================================

# Using your R editor, load this file and edit it, adding R code to complete each exercise.
# Save the file with a new name (for example, append your initials). Then you'll have a 
# record of how you solved the exercises.

# TIPS:
# 	  - Use comments (#) in your code, if you need to explain anything.
# 	  - R is case-sensitive.
# 	  - Type ?<command-name> in the console to access help on an R command
#     - Highlight code you want to run, then click "Run" at the top right of this pane to see the result.
#     - To clear all variables in the workspace, click the broom icon in the Workspace pane.ns

# ---------------------------------

# 1. Defining variables
#
# a. Make the following variable assignments in R. (Tip: just uncomment the lines, select them,
# and click 'Run')
#
 r = exp(2)         	 #exponential function
 q = abs(3 - 7)     	Absolute value of (3-7)
 y = "TRUE"    			
 x = FALSE
 z = NA
#
# b. Using R, find and print the class of each variable. What do you notice about variable y?

# c. Using R, find and print the logical opposite of each variable. Again, what do you notice
# about variable y?

# In the Environment pane (upper Right), toggle between List and Grid view. Which is more useful
# for this exercise? What does the History tab contain?

# When done with the exercise, use the broom icon to clear your RStudio workspace.

# ---------------------------------

# 2. Logical variables
#
# Perform the following in R:
# a. Define variable u as logical True, v as logical False. Hint: these reserved words must
# be all capitals (case is important in R).

# b. In R, determine whether u and v are both true.

# c. In R, determine whether at least one of u OR v is true.

# d. In R, find the opposite of v. 

# When done with the exercise, use the broom icon to clear your RStudio workspace.

# ---------------------------------

# 3. Strings and concatenation 

# a. Assign your first and last names to R two separate R variables.

# b. Use the function paste() to assign the result to a new variable.
# If you need to look up how to use paste, enter "?paste" at the
# command line to bring up the help page.

# c. Print the new variable. Print its type (use the function class(), or look
# in the Environment tab's Grid view).

# When done with the exercise, use the broom icon to clear your RStudio workspace.

# ---------------------------------

# 4. A temperature conversion

# Calculate the Fahrenheit temperatures that correspond to 20 to 25 degrees Celcius, 
# using the steps below.

celsius = c(20:25)	# sets a vector variable to contain the integers 20 through 25

# a. Complete the assignment for the fahrenheit variable. For the formula, refer to: 
# http://www.metric-conversions.org/temperature/celsius-to-fahrenheit.htm
# fahrenheit =

# b. Uncomment this line to create a data frame containing the temperature conversion:
# conversion = data.frame(Celsius=celsius, Fahrenheit=fahrenheit)

# c. Print the temperature conversion.

# You should see:
#   Celsius Fahrenheit
# 1      20       68.0
# 2      21       69.8
# 3      22       71.6
# 4      23       73.4
# 5      24       75.2
# 6      25       77.0

# Did you do the conversion correctly?

# d. Find and print the class of each variable. What are other ways to 
# get this information? 

# e. Find and print the structure of each variable. Use the functions str() and dim().
# Take a look at the help pages for these functions, using ?str at the command line
# or referring to the help pane in RStudio.

# From what you learned about the functions str() and dim():
# What do you think is going on with the celsius and fahrenheit variables?
# What about the conversion variable? 
# (Don't worry, we'll talk about this in the next lecture!)

# When you are done with the exercises, be save this file with a new name.
